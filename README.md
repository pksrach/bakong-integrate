- **Universal Payments:** Customers can pay at any participating bank or merchant by scanning a single KHQR code.
- **Interoperability:** KHQR bridges different banks, making payments simple and unified.
- **Convenience & Inclusion:** Promotes easy access to digital payments for everyone in Cambodia.

Together, BAKONG and KHQR are transforming the way Cambodians pay—securely, instantly, and across all banks.
